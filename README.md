# Deep-Learning-Music-Classification
 Neural Networks for Music Classification using Librosa Library
- Load a file from a URL
- Extract simple features from audio samples for machine learning tasks such as speech recognition and classification
- Build a simple neural network for music classification using these features
- Use a callback to store the loss and accuracy history in the training process
- Optimize the learning rate of the neural network

To illustrate the basic concepts, we will look at a relatively simple music classification problem. Given a sample of music, we want to determine which instrument (e.g. trumpet, violin, piano) is playing. This dataset was generously supplied by Prof. Juan Bello at NYU Stenihardt and his former PhD student Eric Humphrey (now at Spotify). They have a complete website dedicated to deep learning methods in music informatics:
